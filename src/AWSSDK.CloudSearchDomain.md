# AWSSDK.CloudSearchDomain

You use the AmazonCloudSearch2013 API to upload documents to a search domain and search those documents.

The endpoints for submitting `UploadDocuments`, `Search`, and `Suggest` requests are domain-specific. To get the endpoints for your domain, use the Amazon CloudSearch configuration service `DescribeDomains` action. The domain endpoints are also displayed on the domain dashboard in the Amazon CloudSearch console. You submit suggest requests to the search endpoint.

For more information, see the [Amazon CloudSearch Developer Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudsearch/latest/developerguide).
