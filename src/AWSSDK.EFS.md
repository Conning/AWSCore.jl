# Amazon Elastic File System

Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides simple, scalable file storage for use with Amazon EC2 instances in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files, so your applications have the storage they need, when they need it. For more information, see the [User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/efs/latest/ug/api-reference.html).
