# AWSSDK.SQS

Welcome to the *Amazon Simple Queue Service API Reference*.

Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) is a reliable, highly-scalable hosted queue for storing messages as they travel between applications or microservices. Amazon SQS moves data between distributed application components and helps you decouple these components.

**Note**
> [Standard queues](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/standard-queues.html) are available in all regions. [FIFO queues](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/FIFO-queues.html) are available in the US East (N. Virginia), US East (Ohio), US West (Oregon), and EU (Ireland) regions.

You can use [AWS SDKs](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk) to access Amazon SQS using your favorite programming language. The SDKs perform tasks such as the following automatically:

*   Cryptographically sign your service requests

*   Retry requests

*   Handle error responses
