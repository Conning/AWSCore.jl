# Amazon EC2 Systems Manager

Amazon EC2 Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A *managed instance* is any Amazon EC2 instance or on-premises machine in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager.

This reference is intended to be used with the [Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/).

To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see [Systems Manager Prerequisites](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html).
